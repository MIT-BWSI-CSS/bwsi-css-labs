I really enjoy tackling challenges step by step and figuring things out even when they don’t make sense right away.

I’m incredibly passionate about molecular biology — particularly CRISPR and its potential to treat pancreatic cancer in solid tumors. 
I’m excited to start building the computer science skills that support the kind of research I want to go into!

I’m really happy to be here and can’t wait to learn and work with all of you!

I don’t have much experience in computer science yet, but I’m excited for this opportunity! I’m really looking forward to learning alongside all of you!"""
