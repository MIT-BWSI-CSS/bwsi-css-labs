A fun fact about me is that I'm a member of an FRC team (987 Highrollers), and I've been working on my programming, which has been a super exciting journey! With BWSI, I'm really looking forward to potentially learning more about machine learning, large language models, and quantum computing :) I'm looking forward to learning more about computer science and systems in this course! Thank you so much and I can't wait to know you all better!")
