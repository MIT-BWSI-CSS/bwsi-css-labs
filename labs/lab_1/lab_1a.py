This is my first year applying for the BWSI Summer Program, and I'm looking forward to building robots in RACECAR, and learning more about GitHub in this course. I already have limited experience with version control, but I'm interested in expanding my skills. In my free time, I play electric guitar, piano, and chess. Additionally, I like programming and weightlifting.")
